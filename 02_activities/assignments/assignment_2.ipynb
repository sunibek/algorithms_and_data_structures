I approached this by using a two-pointer technique, one pointer to track the current index while iterating through the list, and another to place non-zero values in the correct position. After placing all non-zero elements, I filled the remaining positions with zeros. This allowed me to complete the task in-place, with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.\n",
