    "\n",
    "-   Your computer internally uses a call stack (stack ADT) to execute\n",
    "    functions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When you run your Python file, the `main` function is called.\n",
    "    `main` is pushed onto the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Sounds familiar? `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As the main function executes, it may call other functions, each\n",
    "    function is pushed to the top of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The currently executing function is at the top of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When each function is executed, it is popped from the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The function may return a value, which is passed to the calling\n",
    "    function (the function below in the stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The calling function can use the return value and continue execution\n",
    "    until the stack is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If I run `round(float(\"20.24\"))`, I expect `20`\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The `round` function is first to be called, it is pushed on the\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   `float(\"20.24\")` returns `20.24`\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `round` uses the return value of the previous function, `20.24`.\n",
    "        It executes `round(20.24)`, which returns `20`\n",
